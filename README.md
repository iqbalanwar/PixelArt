# PixelArt

This is a JavaScript pixel-art painting app. The idea came from [this project](http://ga-wdi-exercises.github.io/pixart_js/). In this app, color over the canvas my hovering over the tiles you want to color, based on your chosen color. You can also add a color swatch, and the app will store your current swatch along with your last three swatches. When you click on each of those boxes, it should set the current brush color back to that color.
